## How it works

The processor will read the datas from the four sensors sequentially and analyse whether any deviation has been occoured with respect to the previous data and provide a warning signal also it continuously checks the senor datas and identify any fault has been occured and provides another warning signal with a signal providing the sensor identification.

## How to test

If the sensor identifier data is 00 which means it is sensor1 and input data is 10000001 and this compared with the previously stored data which may be 10000100 for example ,then there is a deviation and the processor will provide output as 1 and the bidirectional as 00.

## External hardware

8 bit ADC is needed to convert the sensor data
